# REST API with Flask

The idea is a laboratory where we will build a Rest API using the Flask framework.

The components we will use:
- Github (SCM)
- Coding (Flask)
- Database (MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas)
- Testing (Local Docker)
- Pipeline (Github Actions)
- Deploy PaaS (Heroku)

## Why use MongoDB?

I used MongoDB because it's a document database, it doesn't have tables or schemas, and because it's not a relational database it was a good option.
